## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to explore and distinguish between face recognition and face verification methods. Through hands-on implementation, I aim to tackle a face recognition problem using one-shot learning, a technique that requires just a single example per class for training. Additionally, I will apply the triplet loss function, which facilitates learning a network's parameters effectively for face recognition tasks.

As part of the project, I will demonstrate how to pose face recognition as a binary classification problem, thereby simplifying the approach to classifying faces accurately. To achieve this, I will map face images into 128-dimensional encodings using a pretrained model, enabling a more compact representation of facial features.
